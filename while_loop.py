# while True means that it will always be true condition
# uncontrolled loop -> infinite loop
# while True:
#     print("I will eat ice cream")
#     condition = input("Do you want to continue? (yes/no): ")
#     if condition == "yes":
#         continue
#     elif condition == "no":
#         break
#     else:
#         print("Oye, i asked yes or no")
#         exit()

# print("Loop ended gracefully")


# while False means that it will never be true condition hence it will never execute the code block inside it
# while False:
#     print("I will eat ice cream")


# Question:
# We will ask a user a number between 0 - 10
# And there will a number already defined by the system.
# If the user guesses the number correctly, we will print "You won" else we will keep asking the number until the user guesses it correctly.


# result = 7
# number = int(input("Guess the number between 0 and 10: "))

# while number != result:
#     print("Wrong guess, try again!")
#     number = int(input("Guess the number between 0 and 10: "))

# print("You won!")

# This will run forever
# while True:
#     print("i want to eat ice cream")

# This will run once
# if True:
#     print("I want to eat ice cream")
